  storyText: 'You wake up, your head pounding with intense pain.


    With blurred
    vision you look around and recognise the navigation room of your spaceship, as
    your momentarily faded memory starts coming back to you.

    thrown off balance by a huge jolt. You must have hit your head and passed out
    for a moment.


    1. Check the navigation logs from the nearby console.

    2.
    Grab your blaster start searching the ship for hostiles.'
