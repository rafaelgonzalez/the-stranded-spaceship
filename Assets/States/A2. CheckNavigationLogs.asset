  storyText: "You type a few commands in the console to run basic diagnostics.\n\nThe
    first thing that becomes apparent is that you actually were out for a few hours.
    \n\nThe next thing you notice is red blinking dots on the map of the ship: organic
    hostiles on board.\n\nShit.\n\nGiven the haul in the storage room, they must
    have been busy bringing it over the ship currently docked to yours, leaving the
    navigation room alone.\n\nIn fact, the storage room reports sever hull damage,
    making it impossible to go in without a suit.\n\n1. Grab your blaster start searching
    the ship for hostiles."
