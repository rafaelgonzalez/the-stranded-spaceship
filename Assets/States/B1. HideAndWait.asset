  storyText: 'You hide in a corner, waiting to hear anything or detect any movement
    coming from the dark hallway.


    After a short time you hear a faint noise,
    something that you eventually recognise - too late - as Xenobug mandibles.


    Something
    drops on you from the ceiling above, and you feel warm blood gushing from your
    neck before the pain of sharp claws ripping through your skin.


    Your face
    hits the ground as you die on the cold metalic floor or the ship.


    1. Try
    again.'
