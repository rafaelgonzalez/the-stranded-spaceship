  storyText: 'You walk a short distance in the hallway. The engine room is a bit
    further down, and your can hear a soft humming coming from it, indicating the
    engine is still operational.


    Then a short, hissing sound comes from straight
    ahead, and a big nasty insect-like shape drops from the ceiling in front of you.


    Your
    aim is quick and you hit the bastard with one single shot from your blaster while
    it dies in a repugnant pile of gore.


    More hissing sounds immediatly come
    from all around you, and you realise too late you walked into a trap. Half a
    dozen bugs jump from the darkness and start clawing and ripping their way through
    your clothes and skin.


    You blast a few in the battle, but you quickly are
    overwhelmed and drop to the floor in pain.


    Your vision darkens, and the
    last thing you see is your insides being pulled out of your body as it is being
    eaten.


    1. Try again.'
