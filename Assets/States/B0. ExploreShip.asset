  storyText: 'You go to the doors, punch a button and they quickly slide open.


    The
    emergency lighting is on, showing the path through the hallway, but darkness
    still fills most of it.

    immediately taken aback by an unbearable stench filling the air. You recognise
    it immediately: Xenobugs.
